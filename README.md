# OWASP Security Culture

This is a documentation project that discusses the importance and benefits of establishing a 
security culture when building an application security program. The guide considers security at
each stage of the Software Development LifeCycle (SDLC), helping to create secure development practices.
Topics discussed include: Defining a maturity goal; Collaboration between security and development
teams; Security Champions; Activities, such as Capture the Flag; Threat modelling; Security testing;
Metrics; all with references to useful relevant OWASP projects.
